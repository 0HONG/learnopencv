# YOLOv7 Object Detection - Paper Explanation and Inference

This repository contains the code for the LearnOpenCV blog post **YOLOv7 Object Detection - Paper Explanation and Inference**.

In this blog post, we go through a comprehensive explanation of the YOLOv7 paper. This includes:

* The YOLOv7 architecture.
* The Bag of Freebies in YOLOv7.
* Training experiments and results from the paper.
* Running inference for object detection using the YOLOv7 and YOLOv7-Tiny model.
* Pose estimation using YOLOv7.



The `yolov7_keypoint.py` script contains the code for pose estimation using the `yolov7-w6-pose.pt` model. **Steps to run**:

* Clone the YOLOv7 repository.
* Download the `yolov7-w6-pose.pt` weights.
* Copy the script into the cloned `yolov7` repository/directory.
* Execute: `python yolov7_keypoint.py`
