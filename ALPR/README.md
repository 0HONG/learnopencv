# Automatic License Plate Recognition

This repository contains code of our blog post Automatic License Plate Recognition. 

This code takes a two step approach where License plates are first detected using [YOLOv4](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) and OCR is then applied using [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) on the detected License plates.

## Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt
