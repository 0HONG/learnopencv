**FCOS:** Fully Convolutional One-stage Object Detection is an anchor-free (anchorless) object detector. 
It solves object detection problems in a per-pixel prediction fashion, similar to segmentation. 
Most of the recent anchor-free or anchorless deep learning-based object detectors use FCOS as a basis. 

The repository contains code for the blog post [FCOS- Anchor Free Object Detection Explained with Code].
