# Depth Estimation using Stereo Camera and OpenCV

Create a custom low-cost stereo camera and capture depth maps with it using OpenCV.

## Using the C++ code
### Compilation
To compile the `obstacle_avoidance.cpp`, `obstacle_avoidance.cpp` and `disparity2depth_calib.cpp` code files, use the following:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
## Usage

### Using the C++ code

Refer to the following to use the compiled files:

```shell
./build/obstacle_avoidance
./build/obstacle_avoidance
./build/disparity2depth_calib
```

### Using the python code

Refer to the following to use the `obstacle_avoidance.py`, `obstacle_avoidance.py` and `disparity2depth_calib.py` files respectively:

```shell
python3 obstacle_avoidance.py
python3 obstacle_avoidance.py
python3 disparity2depth_calib.py
```
